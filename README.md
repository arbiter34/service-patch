# service-patch

A tool that allows for the removal of two limitations present in Ninjhax: service restrictions and inability to patch running processes.

Included is sample code for creating a project that uses process patching. This is currently designed with 9.2 in mind. 

Make sure to run this after running [bootstrap](https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/bootstrap).
